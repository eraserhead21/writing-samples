        <p><b>Hi, Iâ€™m Abhishek. I create user-focused documentation that helps people achieve their
                goals.</b></p>
        <p> I specialize in breaking down complex concepts and workflows into clear, accessible
            guidance that enables users to understand key information and complete tasks
            efficiently. With a strong background background in product management and data
            analytics, I anticipate user needs and ensure that documentation supports both usability
            and strategic business objectives.</p>
